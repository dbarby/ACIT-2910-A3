An interactive website designed to help a range of people decide which laptop to buy based on carefully thought out questions. Simple words and questions were used to help people who are not as familiar with technology understand different aspects that make up a laptop. 

The web application takes users through a series of different questions which as a result, shows the top 3 laptops that match the user's answers. Albeit, less will show if there are not enough laptops in the database to match the user's inputs. 

All of the laptop's information can be added through the admin page’s “Laptop Adder” and Admin profile information can be modified through the “Admin Editor.” Both the laptop adder and admin editor connect to a central database and are optimized by using Ajax. 

Functions that would be optimal to include, but out of scope for this project:
-Question adder
-Product editor
-Dynamic prices being pulled from outside sources 

Instructions:
Run laptopfinder.sql to add the database to phpyAdmin
Ensure Cookies are enabled on browser
**Due to time constraints not all laptops can be added to fulfil every query**
